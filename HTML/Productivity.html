any of your devices - computer, phone or tablet. You don't have to plug it in, except to charge it or if you want
to access your files the old-fashioned way.

  <img style="width:520px" src="../Images/Luxafor2.jpg">
  <p class="content">The Luxafor does wonders for your productivity if you're in an open office environment. When you're sharing the same
space with your coworkers, distractions can be a constant. Using Luxafor can help your coworkers know when you're
busy and need to focus, and when youâ€™re available to chat.
  
Luxafor connects to your computer via USB cable, and you can use it to indicate to your team whether you're available
or busy, by either shining the green light (available) or red light (busy). It helps keep interruptions at a minimum, as
your coworkers will know when not to bother you. Plus, Luxafor can be synced with DeskTime to automatically
shine red or green, depending on the program you're working on.</p>

the eBeam Smartmarker in real-time to anywhere in the world.

Insert just about any regular dry erase marker in the Smartmarker sleeve, and whatever you write or draw will
be captured and shared. No need to send a bunch of blurry photos after a conference or a brainstorming session,
just share notes with your team or clients. With eBeam Smartmarker location cannot limit your communication,
as you can use it on any writing surface.</p>
    
    <p class="title">5. Saent</p>
  <img style="width:520px" src="../Images/Saent2.jpg">
  <p class="content">Saent is a productivity tool that consists of a physical button and an app that blocks distracting online sites and
apps.

According to the creators of Saent: "If you have a physical or visual cue, that makes any behavior change much
stronger if there's something in the environment to actually remind you." So, the button is what does the trick - hit
it and your computer gets a virtual lockdown, where you don't have access to your most common distractions in
previously timed sessions.

The button also acts as a visual cue for your coworkers displaying when you are busy and should not be disturbed,
and lets you know when you should take a break to recharge yourself. Saent also can generate reports on your
productivity levels and work patterns to help you analyze your productivity.</p>
