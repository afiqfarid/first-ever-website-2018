  <p class="content">The ROG Phone II looks like a spec bump more than a design revolution - but as spec bumps go, it's a pretty hefty one.

First off, the display has received a major upgrade. It's a 6.59-inch 1080p OLED panel with an integrated fingerprint
sensor, support for 10-bit HDR, and a Razer Phone 2-matching refresh rate of 120Hz. The touch sampling rate is twice
that, at 240Hz, and Asus claims its touch latency of 49ms is the lowest of any phone. You can choose whether to run
stock Android or Asus' ROG UI as part of the phone's setup process.
    
Behind the screen there's a Snapdragon 855 Plus processor, which is Qualcomm's new gaming-focused SoC that
provides 15 percent faster GPU performance and higher peak clock speeds on the CPU. Asus says its cooling system,
including a vapor chamber and vents, will prevent throttling of the 855 Plus' peak speeds. The ROG Phone II also has
12GB of RAM, up to 512GB of storage, a 48-megapixel camera, and a 6,000mAh battery that the company says should
be good for more than 7 hours of PUBG with the screen set to 60Hz. And there's even a second USB-C port on the
phone - this one on the side - so you can attach an accessory and charge at the same time.</p>
